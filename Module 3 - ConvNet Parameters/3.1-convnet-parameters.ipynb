    "### Using Keras tuner for hyperparameter optimization \n",
    "\n",
    "Blindly trying out different architecture configurations works well enough if you just need something that works okay. In this section, we’ll go beyond \"works okay\", to \"works great and wins machine-learning competitions\", via a quick guide to a set of must-know techniques for building state-of-the-art deep-learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameter optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a deep-learning model, you have to make many seemingly arbitrary decisions: How many layers should you stack? How many units or filters should go in each layer? Should you use relu as activation, or a different function? Should you use BatchNormalization after a given layer? How much dropout should you use? And so on. These architecture-level parameters are called hyperparameters to distinguish them from the parameters of a model, which are trained via backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, experienced machine-learning engineers and researchers build intuition over time as to what works and what doesn’t when it comes to these choices—they develop hyperparameter-tuning skills. But there are no formal rules. If you want to get to the very limit of what can be achieved on a given task, you can’t be content with such arbitrary choices. Your initial decisions are almost always suboptimal, even if you have very good intuition. You can refine your choices by tweaking them by hand and retraining the model repeatedly—that’s what machine-learning engineers and researchers spend most of their time doing. But it shouldn’t be your job as a human to fiddle with hyperparameters all day—that is better left to a machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus you need to explore the space of possible decisions automatically, systematically, in a principled way. You need to search the architecture space and find the best-performing ones empirically. That’s what the field of automatic hyperparameter optimization is about: it’s an entire field of research, and an important one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of optimizing hyperparameters typically looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a set of hyperparameters (automatically).\n",
    "1. Build the corresponding model.\n",
    "1. Fit it to your training data, and measure performance on the validation data.\n",
    "1. Choose the next set of hyperparameters to try (automatically).\n",
    "1. Repeat.\n",
    "1.Eventually, measure performance on your test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to this process is the algorithm that analyzes the relationship between validation performance and various hyperparameter values to choose the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate. Many different techniques are possible: Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, simple random search, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training the weights of a model is relatively easy: you compute a loss function on a mini-batch of data and then use backpropagation to move the weights in the right direction. Updating hyperparameters, on the other hand, presents unique challenges. Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The hyperparameter space is typically made of discrete decisions and thus isn’t continuous or differentiable. Hence, you typically can’t do gradient descent in hyperparameter space. Instead, you must rely on gradient-free optimization techniques, which naturally are far less efficient than gradient descent.\n",
    "* Computing the feedback signal of this optimization process (does this set of hyperparameters lead to a high-performing model on this task?) can be extremely expensive: it requires creating and training a new model from scratch on your dataset.\n",
    "* The feedback signal may be noisy: if a training run performs 0.2% better, is that because of a better model configuration, or because you got lucky with the initial weight values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, there’s a tool that makes hyperparameter tuning simpler: KerasTuner. Let’s check it out."

    "The key idea that KerasTuner is built upon is to let you replace hard-coded hyperparameter values, such as units=32, with a range of possible choices, such as Int(name=\"units\", min_value=16, max_value=64, step=16). The set of such choices in a given model is called the search space of the hyperparameter tuning process.\n",
